# Alexa Tesco Skill

## Description
Alexa Skill integration with Tesco. It allows to voice control the shopping on [Tesco Groceries](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/).
It's possible to add products to the grocery basket by only using the voice.

## Features
At the moment it only allows to add a product to the basket
* Add one item to the Tesco Groceries basket
    * Alexa ask Tesco to add milk to the basket
    * Alexa ask Tesco to add milk
* Add multiple items to the Tesco Groceries basket
    * Alexa ask Tesco to add milk times three
    * Alexa ask Tesco to add some milk -> It will prompt you with a question on how many.

## Requirements
* [NodeJs 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm
* An Amazon Echo/Dot
* [An Amazon developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/)
* A [Tesco Groceries](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/) account
* A [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) account
* A server to process the requests coming from the Echo. In this guide I will use AWS Lambda, so we need als [an Amazon AWS accout](https://aws.amazon.com)

## High level integration

## Installation

Ok let's start by cloning this project: 
```
git clone https://github.com/onegambler/alexa-tesco-skill.git
```

### IFTTT
Tesco doesn't provide public APIs for adding products to the grocery basket; luckily IFTTT has a Tesco integration which provides exactly what we are looking for. So, let's create an account with IFTTT (if you don't have one) and add an applet to do the job:

* Click on `My Applets` and then `New applet`
* Click on the blue `this` and search for `Webhooks`.
    * Give permission to the service by clicking on `Connect` and then on `Receive a web request`
    * As `Event Name` set `tesco_search`. This *needs* to be the same!
    * And click on `create trigger`
* Click now on the blue `that` and search for `Tesco`
    * Give permission to the service by clicking on `Connect`and then on `Search for and add product to basket`
    * Write `{{Value1}}` in the `What to search for` field. It can be also done by clicking on `ingredients` and then `value1`
    * Finally click on `Create action` and then `Finish` 

At the end you should have an applet that looks like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

Once you have created the Applet, we need to copy the Maker URL. So navigate to the Maker webpage, [here](https://ifttt.com/maker), click on Settings and you will see the account info. Something like this:
```
Account Info
Connected as ...
URL https://maker.ifttt.com/use/<KEY>
Status active
```
Copy the `<KEY>` and keep this somewhere as we will need to use it later.

### Customising the products
Now what we need to do is tell the skill which products can be searched and added to the basket.
So, in the project open the file `products.yml` which contains a list of the most common groceries. Alexa will only understand products contained in the list. You can add any product you want, as long as it can be found using the groceries search bar on Tesco.com. **All strings need to be lowercase!**
Also it should be noted that the IFTTT action 
> will search Tesco.com for products matching the search text, and add the first result to your basket.

For this reason, if we want a more precise action and avoid to have the wrong item added, we can specify its id in the list. To do so, go to the Tesco Groceries web page and get the ids for the products you want.
In each product page you can find the id in the url

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9900050/21467441/f19ceb16-c9e5-11e6-96fe-c501691e832e.png" alt="Applet image"/>
</p>

````
http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=264245536
````
In this case *264245536* and then add it to the `products.yml` as shown below.

```yaml
products:
    - banana:
        id: '275280804'
        aliases:
            - bananas
    - cherry tomatoes:
    - milk:
        id: '260569996'
```

By specifying the product id, we can customise the list even further:
```yaml
    - mens deodorant:
        id: '272227552'
        aliases:
            - Roberto's deodorant
```
Once products are mapped, you can save and move to the next step.

### Building the skill
Install node version 6 with npm, if you haven't done it already, and make sure it works properly.

Then `cd` into the folder alexa-tesco-skill and run 
```
npm install
```
to download all dependencies.

The project comes with some `gulp` scripts to make the build process easy. So let's install it globally
```
npm install -g gulp
```
Ok, now we can build the project into a zip file that can be uploaded into the lambda.
```
gulp build
```
If everything went ok, you should now see a `dist` folder and a `dist.zip` file.

### Amazon Lambda
As mentioned before we need an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) as we will deploy the code to AWS Lambda, which will process the requests. The first 1,000,000 requests/month are free, so more than enough to not spend a penny.

There's plenty of tutorials, so I won't get into details. 

*Before setting it up, please note!*
> "Make sure youâ€™ve selected the N.Virginia for English (US) skills or the EU (Ireland) region for English (UK) and German skills. The region is displayed in the upper right corner. Providing your Lambda function in the correct region prevents latency issues" 

Here's a useful link to set up a Lambda for an Alexa Skill, follow the _Creating a Lambda Function for an Alexa Skill_ paragraph:
* https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/developing-an-alexa-skill-as-a-lambda-function

Notes
* create the lambda as `Blank Function`
* configure a `Alexa Skills Kit` as trigger 
* Use Node.js 4.3 as runtime environment
* Set `index.handler` as Handler

So something like this

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9900050/21467577/7d891f1a-c9ea-11e6-9205-e9437916ed6a.png" alt="Applet image"/>
</p>

In order to work properly Lambda needs some environment variables, in the `general` tab we need to add:
* _APP_ID_: It's the lambda identification string, it's not a mandatory parameter, but it makes a little bit more secure by making your lambda only accept requests from your specific skill. It can be found in the Alexa Skill set up page.
* _IFTTT_URL_: It's the IFTTT webhook url. It should be [https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger](https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger)
* _IFTTT_KEY_: It's the IFTTT KEY saved before

Remember to save the Lambda ARN value, found in the top right corner of the dialog, we will need it later.

### Skill Setup
Once you've setup your lambda, you'll need an [Amazon developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/) to create a new Alexa skill.

1. Tab `Skill Information` 
    * Add `Name` and `Invocation Name`. Be aware that the second is the name you are going to use to activate the skill. I use `Tesco`, so I can say "Alexa ask Tesco.." but it's completely up to you.
    * Click `no` on `Audio Player`
    
2. Tab `Interaction Model`
    * Make sure you run the `gulp build` command since it will generate files from `products.yml` needed for the skill set up
    * Paste the content of `dist/speechAssets/IntentSchema.json` into the `Intent Schema` field
    * Paste the content of `dist/speechAssets/SampleUtterances.txt` in the `Sample Utterances` field.
    * Create a `Custom Slot Type` called `GROCERY` and add the content of the file `dist/speechAsset/slot-types/GROCERY`. More info about custom slots can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/defining-the-voice-interface#custom-slot-types).

3. Tab `Configuration`
    * Set `AWS Lambda ARN` as `Service Endpoint Type`, select the correct geographic region (same as Lambda) and insert the Lambda ARN in the input field.

4. Ignore other tabs (we don't want to publish the skill) and click on `Save`

# Putting everything together
Ok, almost there. As last step we need to deploy the file into AWS Lambda. The project comes with `node-aws-lambda`; a node utility used for Lambda's deployment. You can read more about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-aws-lambda).
I honestly prefer to do it manually so I don't have to deal with access keys and tokens; so let's go back to the newly created lambda - on the AWS console page - and let's upload the `dist.zip` file.
Then click on `save` and we should be ready to go. Try to add some milk and see if it works!

# Issues
Here's are some issues you might face using the skill
* *The item mapped is not available anymore*: Unfortunately I haven't found a way yet to know if an item becomes unavailable for a specific Tesco branch. IFTTT doesn't respond with errors in that case, so Alexa will say that everything went ok,even if the product is not added to the basket. Tesco as well doesn't provide APIs to get this kind of info. In my experience this happens mostly with seasonal fruit and vegetables and  it hasn't been a big issue for me so far. I'm still looking for a workaround.
